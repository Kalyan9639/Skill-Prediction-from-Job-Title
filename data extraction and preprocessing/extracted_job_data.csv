UX Design & Development - Healthcare Journey,"Our customers are currently struggling to find the correct accessories for their products, so we’re looking to improve their post-purchase journey.



Background:
Our audience is primarily 45+ years old, and some are not very computer-literate. This makes searching for compatible accessories on our site challenging.



The focus will be on existing customers who have purchased a TENS or EMS machine from us. These machines come with electrodes, which are essential for operation. Electrodes typically wear out after about a month (depending on usage).



The problem:
When customers return to our website, they may:
- Own an older machine we no longer sell.
- Have a current machine but be unsure which electrodes to buy.
- Be looking for other compatible accessories (garments, probes, cables) and struggle to find the right match.



As a result, they often get lost on the site and call us for help — which increases our support workload.



The goal of this project:
- Create a clear, guided process for customers to find compatible accessories quickly.
- Recommend alternative products if their machine is outdated.
- Offer incentives (discounts, trade-ins, etc.) for upgrading to a new machine.
- Reduce confusion and lower the volume of daily support calls.



Considerations:
- The process needs to be mapped out and designed to fit Shopify’s design restrictions and constraints.
- The solution will initially be for the UK and Ireland, but it must be translatable for future expansion.
- Website: www.med-fit.store



Next steps:
Please let me know:
- Any questions you have about the project.
- Your estimated cost for delivering it.
- Your estimated timeline for completion.","User Flow, User Experience Design, Journey Mapping, Mockup, Wireframing, Interaction Design, Usability Testing, Responsive Design",jobs.json

- Exploring and advising on AI-first solutions to streamline operations
- Writing clear documentation and sharing knowledge with non-technical team members

Who We Are Looking For

Essential:
- Based in South Africa or Eastern Europe
- 1+ years experience in automation, integrations, or software development
- Hands-on experience with API design and workflow automation tools such as Zapier, Make, n8n, or LangChain
- Comfort with AI tools such as prompt engineering, embeddings, or model fine-tuning basics
- Some full stack ability in React, Vue, Node.js, Python, or similar
- Excellent communicator who can explain technical solutions clearly to non-technical teammates
- Independent and resourceful, comfortable scoping, building, and deploying on your own

Bonus:
- Experience in startup or fast-moving environments
- Previous work on AI flows, retrieval augmented generation systems, or knowledge bots
- Data handling or ETL pipelines experience
- Long-term mindset, committed to growing with us for 3+ years
- Solution-oriented and eager to shape Spark’s tech direction as we scale

Perks
- Fully remote with flexible hours
- Autonomy to design and own core systems
- A chance to build AI-driven operations in a high-growth startup
- Direct impact across the company
- Long-term opportunity to evolve into a leadership role as we grow our tech team
